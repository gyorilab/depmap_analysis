# DepMap Analysis

DepMap Analysis is a project that aims at providing an automated framework 
for explaining high-throughput scientific data.

## Source of crispr data

We use the CRISPr data from the Dependency Map 
[portal](https://depmap.org/portal/) managed by the Broad Institute to look at
genetic dependency on viability. Specifically, we look at the gene effect data.

## Funding

DepMap Analysis is funded as part of the DARPA Automated Scientific Discovery 
Framework (ASDF), grant number W911NF018-1-0124.
